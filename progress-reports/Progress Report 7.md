## Student Progress:

**John**

Fixed permission and connection issues in cordova group chat app. Created React Native group chat app demo as an alternative. React Native seems like the better platform choice to use, so Dan and I will work on this going forward. Our goals for the group chat app are invocation from Alexa and channel selection. Also, added Wit.ai support to Questionnaire framework to help Lauren and Yanqi with keyword/entity matching.

**Yanqi**

Researched on wit.ai suggested by John. Worked with Lauren on enabling keyword catching in user response via wit.ai. Added multiple entities in wit.ai such as negative, positive, time_management and course_materials. Incorporate wit.ai into our existing mental health dialogue with the help from John. Next week, we are going to sharpen up the conversation and add related advice as responses to users. 
        
**Dan**

Did React Native tutorials to learn how to develop the group chat app. Will work with John going forward to continue adding features to the app. Specifically, we will work on launching the app from Alexa. Beyond that, we also look to create multiple channels that users can join and allow users to have usernames. Also, I will continue doing React Native tutorials and experimenting to get more familiar with React Native.
    
**Lauren**

Met with Dr. Ian Birky to ask about suggestions for our project and gain insight on how to give advice to students. Looked into different options for NLU, decided to go with wit.ai.  Worked with Yanqi on creating the different keywords and specific phrases/expressions that we expect to see in the user responses.  Linked wit.ai with our Alexa Skill (with help of John) and created basic conversation flow. Next week we will sharpen up the conversation. 
    
    
## Overall Progress:
* Added wit.ai support to include NLU in our structured conversation/questionnaire framework
* Fixed permission and connection issues in cordova group chat prototype
* Created working React Native group chat prototype with react-native-webrtc
* Met with Dr. Birky to gain counseling advice for project

## Future Plans:
* Make the full implementation of our structured conversation with wit.ai
* Allow group chat app to be invoked from Alexa
* Refine group chat app design
* Start thinking about the final presentation
