## Student Progress:

**John**

Met with Dan to research the possibility of a live group-chat feature for Alexa. We found that this is not possible to do natively as Alexa skills cannot remain open after conversations and will not speak live updates. Instead, we found a workaround that would involve hosting a live streaming audio cast and doing our own text-to-speech, feeding user inputs to this cast which Alexa can tune in to. We wrote up a doc about the details and pitfalls of this approach. This week I will continue looking into how we can approach this issue.
	
**Yanqi**

Refined our Mental Health Questionnaire by adding more questions and changing the flow. Had a video meeting with professor DuPaul to gain his professional insights regarding anxiety among college students. Interview a friend and my dad who smoke/smoked about their opinions regarding our smoking questionnaire and smoking itself. 
	
**Dan**

Worked with John to figure out how we could implement an Alexa group chat skill. We wrote up a design doc and will continue looking into how this can be implemented for our project.
	
**Lauren**	

Worked with Yanqi to revamp the Mental Health Questionnaire, has more appropriate questions for first time users. Video chatted with Prof. DuPaul about how his knowledge on working with college age ADHD students could apply to our project. Next week I am going to work on creating a more specific flow of conversation for the structured dialogue portion of our project.
	
## Overall Progress:
* Refined the Mental Health Questionnaire by adding more questions and changing the flow. 
* Met with DuPaul to gain advice on mental health issues.
* Researched and wrote-up an approach for implementing a live group chat Alexa skill

## Future Plans:
* Refine the google doc with all of the mental health related questions in order to start forming the structured conversation flow.
* Continue researching how we can implement a live anonymous group chat, with or without involving Alexa
* Continue exploring virtual reality content/environment creation with platforms such as High Fidelity
* Work on our sprint 1 presentation which will be given Monday, March 18th.
