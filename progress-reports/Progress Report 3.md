## Student Progress:

**John**
	
Created a simple framework for dynamic questionnaires in Jovo. It enables us to break our questionnaire into sections and jump between sections depending on user responses. Remade and added questions to the smoking questionnaire from last week. Showed the team how to use and extend the new questionnaire skill.

**Yanqi**

Created the Mental Health Questionnaire demo (via Jovo) with Laruen. Next week, we are going to meet with professor DuPaul. I will interview a few people I know who smoke or smoked, and ask them what they think about our smoking questionnaire and other related questions. 
	
**Dan**

Updated and added to the smoking questionnaire, fine tuning some of the wording for questions and adding new sections/questions. Investigated how to potentially implement a group chat feature using Alexa. Next week we plan to further improve the smoking questionnaire.

**Lauren**	

Worked on the Mental Health Questionnaire demo (via Jovo) with Angie. Set up a meeting time with Prof. DuPaul to learn about how he interacts with ADHD students. Next week we plan to refine the questions and flow of the mental health questionnaire, hopefully with help from Prof. DuPaulâ€™s input.

## Overall Progress:
* Created a new flexible questionnaire skill/framework with Jovo that takes advantage of the Alexa Dialog Interface.
* Developed a Mental Health Questionnaire demo using Jovo and the new framework.
* Remade and extended the Smoking Questionnaire from last week.

## Future Plans:
* Refine the Mental Health and Smoking Questionnaire regarding the questions and flow. 
* Look into virtual reality development with High Fidelity.
* Meet with professor DuPaul to gather advice about mental health. 
* Interview friends who smoke or smoked before.
