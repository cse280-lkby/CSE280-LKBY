## Student Progress:

**John**

Worked with Dan to implement a username feature in our react native group chat app. Added Firebase Cloud Messaging support to the app so that we can send notifications to launch the app from our backend. Created new demo Alexa skill to send a notification to a user’s phone using the Firebase admin api. This week I will continue to polish the app and prepare everything for Wednesday’s demo.

**Yanqi**

Finished up Mental Health Dialogue by adding tips for test anxiety, time management, and course materials. Next week, we will be focusing on the mid-year presentation. If time allowed, we will add more tips and make them rotate when users activate them. 

**Dan**

Continued working on the react native android group chat app. I did more tutorials and worked with John to implement a username feature where users can input their usernames, which will then be displayed to other users in the group chat. I also added a speakerphone feature where the chat is now always on speakerphone, similar to Alexa. We will continue working on the group chat app, specifically to add a self mute option. Then, we want to work towards adding a group text based chat.
    
**Lauren**

Cleaned up the sections.js file for the Mental Health Dialogue skill. Added tips for test anxiety, time management, and not understanding content based on what the user says. The next step is to add different tips that we can rotate between so the user doesn’t hear the same response every time.
