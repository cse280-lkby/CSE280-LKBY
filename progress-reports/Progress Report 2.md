## Student Progress:

**John**
	Created IAM group for the team to collaborate on AWS and moved our existing Lambda functions to the new group. Began work on a Jovo based smoking data collection skill called Smoking Questionnaire, which will use structured conversation to gather info about user smoking habits and store this in a database. This week I will work with Dan to expand this.

**Yanqi**
	Read the Reddit’s mental health forum as professor Chuah suggested last time. Expanded mental health info call protocol to cover more topics I found in Reddit. Fixed the error with downloading Jovo. Lauren and I will work on a Jovo based mental health data collection skill called Mental Health Questionnaire.

**Dan**
	Created a team account on alexa developer, allowing us to collaborate on Alexa skills. I also moved our existing Alexa flash briefing skills to this account. I began formulating the smoking questionnaire that our skill will follow to collect data. Investigated the capabilities of Google Home and Alexa to support unstructured conversation and accepting not predefined responses. This coming week I will work with John to flesh out the smoking questionnaire.

**Lauren**
	Talked with the cofounder of Active Minds, the club centering around mental health, and learned about what they cover in meetings.  We got a list of topics that the members want to discuss and things that they want to learn more about -- these topics will be a good starting point for what we include in our skill. Read through Reddit and compiled a list of commonly faced problems and positive responses to peoples’ issues. This week I will work with Angie on creating the Mental Health Questionnaire on Jovo.
