## Student Progress:

**John**
Continued to research WebRTC on Android with Dan. Talked to the CITL people and got access to Building C’s VR/AR development lab. Started refactoring/modernizing code from last week’s group audio chat demo. Created free tier Amazon EC2 Ubuntu cloud instance for hosting group chat signalling server. Ported the demo to a somewhat working Android app using Cordova. Currently having some permission/connection issues and will work on fixing these for next week. 

**Yanqi**
Assisted Lauren in forming the academic-prone Mental Health Dialogue skill. Next week, I will work on refining the academic questionnaire skill as professor Chuah suggested during the meeting. I will schedule a meeting with Dr. Birky when we are done refining the skill for professional insights. 
		
**Dan**
Worked with John to research WebRTC and how to create a voice chat app on Android. We explored methods such as Cordova and native Android code. Tested demos through web browser. We will continue to work on implementing and polishing the Android app for audio chat.
	
**Lauren**
Transformed academic questions document into Mental Health Dialogue Skill. Asked fellow student athletes about how they deal with stress and anxiety. Worked on the beginning of the Coping skill questions and structure. Next week I plan to refine the Mental Health Dialogue conversation and continue working on the Coping Skill.
