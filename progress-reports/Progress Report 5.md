## Student Progress:

**John**

Worked with Dan to setup a DynamoDB for storage of smoking questionnaire answers. Researched how to facilitate conference calls with platforms like Twilio. Researched WebRTC with Dan to set up a live group audio chat demo. We were able to get a demo working for browsers and are hoping to make it work on Android this week.

**Yanqi**

Went to the “Stress Less” counseling session with Lauren on Wednesday to learn about how therapists respond to students’ academic stress. Started to work on the mental health questionnaire and changed it to more academic-relevant. 
		
**Dan**

Worked with John to setup a DynamoDB on AWS for storing smoking questionnaire answers. Researched how to launch an app using Alexa and how to facilitate group calls/chats with webRTC. Worked with John to set up a live group web-based audio chat demo. Our plans for this week are to create an Android app that will run this audio chat demo.
		
**Lauren**

Attended “Stress Less” counseling session to learn about how the counseling center approaches dealing with student academic issues. Started implementing academic dialogue with Angie.  Adjusted the flow for academic questions.

## Future Plans:
* Make group audio chat work on android

* Look into creating a forum feature for the android app
* Finish implementation of the academic questions
* Start assembling the questions for the coping strategies skill
