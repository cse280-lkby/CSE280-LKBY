
#### Meeting Time: Fridays 11am

## Student Progress:

  

**John**

Added support for context and immediate responses to the questionnaire framework, which enables more realistic conversations that weren’t possible before. Forked the Smoking Questionnaire to the new Smoking Dialogue skill. Worked with Dan to add Wit.ai NLP to the skill and started rewriting the conversation flow to take advantage of the new framework features.

  

**Yanqi**

Read through two documents related to mental health support conversation. Implemented the feature directing the user to call counselling center when College Buddy cannot understand what the user says. Started to find a time for training session.

**Dan**

Worked with John to add Wit.ai NLP to the smoking dialogue skill. Used the new context feature to make personalized and empathetic responses. Worked with John to come up with the new way to have a response said without needing a response.

  

**Lauren**

Worked with Yanqi to add case for when the user says something the Alexa can’t understand. Before it would respond with the “positive” response case, now it responds with counseling center contact information. Recruited 4 student athletes to test out our app.

## Overall Progress:

* Added context and immediate response support to questionnaire framework

* Created new Smoking Dialogue skill using Wit.ai based on the Mental Health Dialogue skill

* Recruited 4 student athletes to test our mental health skill

  

## Future Plans:

* Train participants on how to use our Mental Health skills and get feedback from them.

* Use the new context and response features to restructure/personalize/improve our Mental Health and Smoking Dialogue skills.
