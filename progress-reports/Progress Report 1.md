## Student Progress:


**John**

Documented and shared the “Smoking Health Updates” demo flash briefing skill with the team. Helped create a similar skill for “Mental Health Updates”. Researched possible ways to use DialogFlow with Alexa and alternative platforms. Sadly it doesn’t look like DialogFlow is the way to go for Alexa. Next week I want to make a structured conversation demo with Jovo similar to the one I created on DialogFlow to see how that compares.


**Yanqi**

Came up with questions that will help us gather information about one’s mental state. Expanded the mental health info call protocol document in a hierarchical way. Created the “Smoking Health Updates” skill that was shared by John on my Alexa Developer Console. Next week I plan to do some research on Jovo and help make the structured conversation demo using it as well as populate the existing mental health info call protocol document by incorporating form discussion regarding this issue on Reddit. 
        
**Dan**

Helped formulate a structure of how to ask questions to gather information about a person struggling with anxiety/depression. Helped create the “Mental Health Updates” flash briefing for Alexa. Next week, I plan to start building a backend based off the demo that Xin Li shared with us to start making the structured conversation.


**Lauren**

Enabled already existing Alexa Skills related to anxiety and depression.  Noted the aspects of each skill that could use improvement or could be useful to our skill.  Researched Amazon Alexa’s new name-free interactions.  Talked to the cofounders of the new Lehigh club Active Minds, they agreed to help give insight about group meetings. Next week, I plan to meet with the club founders and learn about their meetings and topics they cover. 


## Overall Progress:
We created two flash briefings, one for “Smoking Health Updates” and one for “Mental Health Updates” as a method of encouraging people to seek help. Looking at the available software, we decided that DialogFlow is likely to be incompatible with our project, so we started investigating Jovo. We started formulating the structure of the information gathering conversation the College Buddy will hold with people to gather basic necessary information that can be used later on in a personalized manner.




## Future Plans:


* Look into how we can work better as a team on Amazon Web Services and the Alexa Developer tools (i.e. collaboration on a single project)
* Continue work on the structured conversation for both the quit smoking skill and the mental health skill
* Update the flash briefings to provide helpful tips/advice.
* Research Alexa skills with a group calling feature or see if it would be possible to implement
* Perform more data collection about personal struggles and positive responses from Reddit and other forums
* Smoking data collection skill
